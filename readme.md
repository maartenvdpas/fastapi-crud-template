# FastAPI CRUD Template
This is a basic FastAPI template for CRUD applications featuring:
- Jinja2, for templating
- SQLAlchemy, for SQL Database handling
- Alembic, for migrating said SQL Databases

Will probably update this with other boilerplate code such as:
- User authentication (including hashing)
- Flexible build system
- Well documented example code
